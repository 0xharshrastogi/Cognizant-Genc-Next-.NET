    <h1>Why to Learn java Programming?</h1>
    <div>
      <p title="Java Programming">
        Java is a MUST for students and working professionals to become a great Software
        Engineer specially when they are working in Software Development Domain. I will
        list down some of the key advantages of learning Java Programming:
      </p>

      <dl>
        <dt class="reasons">Object Oriented</dt>
        <dd id="description01">
          In Java, everything is an Object. Java can be easily extended since it is based
          on the Object model.
        </dd>
        <dt class="reasons">Platform Independent</dt>
        <dd id="description02">
          Unlike many other programming languages including C and C++, when Java is
          compiled, it is not compiled into platform specific machine, rather into
          platform independent byte code. This byte code is distributed over the web and
          interpreted by the Virtual Machine (JVM) on whichever platform it is being run
          on.
        </dd>

        <dt class="reasons">Simple</dt>
        <dd id="description03">
          Java is designed to be easy to learn. If you understand the basic concept of
          <em>OOP Java</em>, it would be easy to master.
        </dd>
        <dt class="reasons">Secure</dt>
        <dd id="description04">
          With Java's secure feature it enables to develop virus-free, tamper-free
          systems. Authentication techniques are based on public-key encryption.
        </dd>
        <dt class="reasons">Architecture-neutral</dt>
        <dd id="description05">
          Java compiler generates an architecture-neutral object file format, which makes
          the compiled code executable on many processors, with the presence of Java
          runtime system.
        </dd>
        <dt class="reasons">Portable</dt>
        <dd id="description06">
          Being architecture-neutral and having no implementation dependent aspects of the
          specification makes Java portable.
          <em>Compiler in Java is written in ANSI C</em> with a clean portability
          boundary, which is a POSIX subset.
        </dd>
        <dt class="reasons">Robust</dt>
        <dd id="description07">
          Java makes an effort to eliminate error prone situations by emphasizing mainly
          on compile time error checking and runtime checking.
